This is what little information I've got about the firmware. This was translated from the original Chinese comments.
The firmware for a GSLX680 is just a list of values for it's paged registers. It appears a GSLX680 has a lot of registers. It looks like a great deal of settings are from software not hardware. There is also a checksum that will interfer with hacking a firmware to work on multiple hardware. Result is each hardware configuration will need it's own firmware.
